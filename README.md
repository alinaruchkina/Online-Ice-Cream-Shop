This is my project, which was written after completing the Java Script tutorial from Orion Innovation.

The task was to write an online store in React.
I used technologies:
1.ReactJS
2.Redux
3.React-router-dom

 Use the following command to install the project on your computer:
npm install
To start a project:
npm start
The project is already built

Implemented a collection of product cards, adding them to the cart, deleting all cards, deleting one card.
If the user tries to add a card that is already in the cart, then the number of cards is increased.
Conclusion: happy viewing my project
